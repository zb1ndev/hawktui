# hawktui
A [stb-style](https://github.com/nothings/stb) header-only c library for making beautiful terminal UIs.

> [!WARNING]
> This is an incomplete library, and lacks many promised features.

## Usage
To use [hawktui](https://github.com/zb1ndev/hawktui), simply copy and paste `hawktui.h` into your include path or wherever I really dont care, define `HAWKTUI_IMPLEMENTATION` and include `hawktui.h` in a source file and compile.
```c
#define HAWKTUI_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "hawktui.h"
```
